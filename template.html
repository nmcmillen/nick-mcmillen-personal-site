    <p><strong>What did you learn about that helped you understand the development process?</strong> 
        <p>Trying to wrap my head around best practices for learning and understanding the development process has been a little tricky these first couple of weeks. Sort of like getting thrown in the deep end, I'm just learning how to tread water before I can learn to swim. This week I tried to make more notes as I came across things that may be helpful to my project. I paid more attention to some various videos and code to see how people were formatting their code and steps taken to get to an end result. I would say larning async/await was actually helpful in understanding how to be a better developer by building one thing at a time. First block of code is getting data, then setting state, and finally updating the DOM. Each one relies on the main data block of code in order to do anything. Then you can fill other items of code in. Overall, I felt I understood more of what my big rocks are all the way down to the grains of sand to fill in the gaps</p>

    <p><strong>What does it mean to develop good code?</strong>
        <p>To me, developing good code means being clear, concise, and efficient. You also want to make each block of code as powerful as it can be so you're not creating a couple lines of code each time you need something extra. I'm also incredibly OCD about how my code is formatted, which has also helped me be able to read through my code and add, subtract, or fix as necessary because I'm able to understand what things are and what they do within my code.</p>

    <p><strong>What does it mean to be a good developer?</strong>
        <p>Being a good developer can mean many things. I think a good developer is someone who is always trying to learn, asks questions, and isn't afraid to say if they don't know how to do something. A good developer writes clean and efficient code that can be read and worked with by others on their team. You want a developer who can grow, adapt, and hit the end goal of what is important for their customers and users.</p> 

    <p><strong>What is one thing that programmers hate doing?</strong>
        <p>I think that list is much longer than just ONE thing! If I had to choose, I would go with having to go back and redo their code and especially someone elses when it's messy.</p>
