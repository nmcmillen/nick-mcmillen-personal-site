<p><strong>What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?</strong></p>

<p>While I feel I learned a ton in our first in-person sprint week, I absolutely felt held back at times. When it comes down to being held back, I mostly feel it's just a plain lack of syntax knowledge which will come with experience. I was excited for the Mind Reader project after pseudocoding everything, reading the documentation, and having my plan of attack on building a JSON file to pull data from. That was until I hit a huge wall. I made it through building my JSON file and pulling some of the data, but I could not for the life of me figure out how to correctly pull data from my fetch into a function to where I could switch my data for each card. I had asked some questions and got some help, but after we reached the end of the day, I went home still not successfully understanding how to pull the data and pretty much nuked my progress and threw my code in the javascript graveyard. I started from scratch and went with a new plan. While my new plan and code worked, it was not how I wanted to create my project and I think stinted potential learning. I later found out on demo day I was incredibly close to success with my first bit of code when I gave up. Had I asked one more question, a last plea for help, I would've been able to break through that wall. At the end of the day I held myself back because I was afraid of asking for help again and became impatient. But I've now learned something, something I can build on and not make that mistake again. Better to learn this earlier than later!</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?</strong></p>

<p>For me, I really want to learn more and more JavaScript. I find JSON and API's somewhat fascinating in being able to grab data and produce it into something useful. It's also where I have found I have struggled the most with in a couple projects I've now worked on. I'm hoping I will soon break through my barrier with those two!</p>

<p><strong>How does In-Person Bootcamp compare to Remote Onboarding?</strong></p>
<p>I enjoyed being in person more than I thought I would to be honest. Remote onboarding felt like just doing the homework you were given and sort of being on your own. While I work well on my own, being in the presence of other students and our instructors who are motivated to accomplish this bootcamp together has given me more motivation. Everyone in our group has been incredibly welcoming, open, and helpful so far. I feel like we are coming together quickly and working well as a team already. In a way, it already kind of feels like a family in a sense. We are all wanting to change something in our lives, to something greater, and are holding each other accountable to be the best we can be. I am very much looking forward to sharing our struggles, our successes, our laughs, and our cries together along the way. </p>

<p><strong>What is your “Why”?</strong></p>

<p>I am here in the bootcamp because I felt it's where I needed to be. I needed to do something new. Something difficult. Something creative. I have always struggled with stagnation and hit a point in my life/career where I felt I needed a new challenge to set me in a different direction. I was looking for a new journey and thanks to a good friend, I was pushed towards web development and programming. I have always been intrigued with it and always wanted to understand the magic of it all. My true "Why?" is that I don't have another option I would feel comfortable falling back on. It's uncomfortable, but I kind of jumped off the cliff and planned to learn to fly on the way down. I did the same thing when I decided I was going to try to race cars professionally. I made the leap and gave myself no other option than to dedicate myself to becoming just that and I did it. I've learned that I have to jump all the way in to something or I won't learn, I won't be successful. I've now given myself no other option than to learn, be a good developer, a great one even, because I cannot stand only being statisfactory.</p>
