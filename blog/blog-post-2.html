<p><strong>What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?</strong>
<br>
While I know we have not touched on it much yet, Javascript. I feel I understand HTML and CSS enough to be able to navigate my way through creating something that looks reasonably well, but I am really wanting to bring more function into what I can make with HTML and CSS.</p>
<p><strong>What are you struggling with?</strong>
<br>
In terms of the work we have been given so far, I don't feel there's anything I'm struggling with yet. There have been some additional small projects I am trying to work on in addition where you essentially need to create a project from scratch. Something like a Frontend Mentor challenge where you have an end result they provide you with and maybe some basic code, but you have to create that small project from scratch and figure out how to build it effectively and efficiently. Since there is no specific way to get to the end result, sometimes I don't feel like I know where to start and when/where to add the pieces needed. I imagine this comes with experience and figuring out your preferred workflow.</p>
<p><strong>How do you solve a problem?</strong>
<br>
When it comes to programming, I typically try a couple solutions I know off the top of my head to see if it changes/fixes the problem or at least helps me understand my problem better. Then I can narrow down the keywords I'm looking for or the exact problem in order to effectively research my problem. I try to read or watch a few different solutions and find something that I understand best and follow to resolve my problem. Maybe I take something that already works to test it, modify it, break it, whatever helps me better understand how something actually functions.</p>
<p><strong>What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?</strong>
<br>
Often times going back to the beginning and reviewing everything I've just done step by step just to see if there's something small that I've missed or skipped. Far too many times there's something incredibly small that was looked over causing me to get stuck. I'll also just go occupy my time with something else to take a break from my issue since I've found myself thinking or staring at an issue for too long that I just can't figure out. Taking a step back and going into it again with a fresh mind seems to do the trick. My all time favorite, reverse engineering. I feel like there's so much to learn from taking something you know works and just looking at how all the pieces go together and understanding WHY they go together. If all else fails, I'm going to someone who knows more than I do!</p>
